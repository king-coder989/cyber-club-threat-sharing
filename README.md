# cyber-club-threat-sharing
Project Overview Concept: A decentralized platform for your college cyber club to anonymously share and retrieve cyber threat intelligence (e.g., malicious IPs, phishing URLs) using an Ethereum smart contract. The contract stores threats on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof data and anonymity via hashed user IDs.
